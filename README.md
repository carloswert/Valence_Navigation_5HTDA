The repository contains:

1. Code for simulations: Our implementation is based on [Zannone _et al.,_ (2017)](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/showmodel.cshtml?model=245018). We include Python codes for STDP and rate-based versions of sequential weight change (SWC) and competitive weight change (CWC). The output is a pickle file to be analysed.
2. Code for statistical analysis: Jupyter notebook
3. Files with the datasets used in the article:
